This is a script that I use to set myself reminders on the command line.
Each reminder will be delivered to my Email Inbox on the day I specifiy.
If you'd like to use it, you can follow the steps below to do so.

#### Use
- download the script:
`git clone https://github.com/JohannesSeikowsky/Eminder.git`
- move its directory to a location of your choice that's included in your $PATH
- make scripts executable
`chmod +x email_rem`
`chmod +x utils.py`
- Now you should be able to run on the command line:
`email_rem`
- Now everytime you run this it will ask you for the content and the date of a new reminder
