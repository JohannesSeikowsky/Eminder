This is a small application that allows me to set myself reminders via the command line.
Each reminder once set will then be delivered to my Gmail Inbox on a specified day.

If you'd like to use it, you can do so by downloading the application and making a few adjustment.
In that case drop me a quick email and I'll provide some guidance as to what needs to be done - joseikowsky@gmail.com
