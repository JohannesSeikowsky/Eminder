This is a small application I use to set myself reminders on the command line.
Each reminder will then be delivered to my Gmail Inbox via Email on a specified day.

If you'd like to use it, you can do so by downloading it and making a few adjustment.
Drop me a quick email and I'll provide some guidance - joseikowsky@gmail.com
