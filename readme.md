This is a small application that lets me set reminders via the command line.
Each reminder, once set, will then be delivered to my Gmail Inbox on its specified day.

If you'd like to use it, you can do so by downloading the application code and making a few adjustment.
Should that be the case, drop me a quick message and I'll provide some guidance as to what needs to be done - joseikowsky@gmail.com
